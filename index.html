          <p>I'm a free spirit who always tries her best and always aim for something bigger. I want to achieve great things in the future, so I have to work really hard now to get there. Only good vibes.</p>

            <h3>Barista</h3>
            <p>I work as a barista at Starbucks Golden Bull in Debrecen, Hungary. I love my job and I love my fellow Partners (some more than I should probably). Obviously it has downsides too, but I'm trying to stay positive at all times. I love coffee and I love making people smile and wish them a good day.</p>

            <h3>Web Development</h3>
            <p>I'm not a master at the craft yet, but I'm trying my best. I've always been interested in Web development but I didn't have the right tools to achieve my goals. Now I think I found my way, huge thanks to Angela Yu from <a href="https://www.appbrewery.co/"> The App Brewery</a>.</p>

            <h3>English</h3>
            <p>I've been learning English since I was 4 years old. I think I've been able to build a stable proficiency throughout the years. I still have some areas where I'm lacking but there's always room for improvement. I believe in lifelong learning.</p>

            <h3>Korean</h3>
            <p>I've started liking Kpop in 2013. I've been a fan since. I got to know the Korean language since then, and I have a huge interest in it. Although I haven't had the chance to dive deeper in the learning, I plan to do that. I think the culture and the broad history is fascinating.</a>.</p>
